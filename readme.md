Hi! Here's how to use this:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Go to localhost:5500 in your browser

This is mostly for my own convenience, but I figured I'd share in case it's also convenient for anyone else. My utils/index.js file usually gets filled up with a bunch of weird functions that don't do what I want but then get used later in other sketches. Truly, in the grand tradition of sketchbooks, there's a lot of experimentation in here. So, edit any way you want.

What we're using:
- Express 
- Webpack
- Handlebars
- P5

Finally, f you want to use GLSL shaders, images, fonts, or other imported files in your P5 projects, put them in the public folder!

If you're wondering what the hell codesketchtober is, here's the gist
